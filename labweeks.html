        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class = "topic_block">
            <p>For HCI lab weeks I was assigned to the team that had to create the installation for the topics Playful Interactions. The goal of lab weeks is to create the installation within the assigned topic and present the final prototype and experience on the expo at the end of two weeks. As stated by the topic, the installation has to present the interaction and created playful experience for visitors, and preferably has an open-ended interaction.</p>

            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>In the first day we had a team building exercise with our new team where we came up with the team name and tangible logo. Our team is called WingPlay and represents the team of people who love exploring new cultures and things.</p>

            <p><span>Brainstorming ideas</span><br>Before starting the brainstorming for the concept, our team shared some of the ideas everyone already had individually, and we shared with each other what interactions we would be interested to work on. For example, we discussed the possibility to implement touch interactions, temperature detection etc. After that, we spent some time brainstorming the ideas, doing research on existing interactive projects, composing inspiration board on MIRO. After that, we had the summary and approximate direction we would like to go. </p>

            <p><span>Temperature change interaction</span><br>
              I personally started exploring the temperature interaction and worked with Arduino kit to make different LED lights light up depending on the temperature. As the input was shown in random number value and not celcius, it was difficult to makes sense out of it to work with it further. I needed to convert this value into temperature value, so it was quite challenging to figure out how to convert input from a thermistor voltage divider to a temperature value - celsius. By the end of the day, I managed to build a code that works with celsius temperature, using the formula that represents linear relation between temperature value and output voltage, as thermistos resistance decreased when the temperature increases.</p>

            <h2>Day 2</h2>
            <p>Today my team and I were focusing on working with LED strips, interaction with the button and capacitive touch. We also worked on the animations in Processing that depends on sound/frequency level.</p>
            <p><span>Starting with LED strip</span><br>
              I was working together with another team mate on creating the interaction with the button and LED strips. First, we were figuring out how to connect the LED strip to the Arduino properly and call for each individual light on the strip</p>
            <p>First, we managed to code the way that each light lights up after another after some short delay. Our goal was to make several LED lights light up together in one color, then next group of lights in another color etc. Working with LED strips was more exciting than with LED pins, but also required more coding and time for us to figure out how it works. This is the result that we got at the end.</p>

              After that, we wanted to create an interaction with the button, so the specific lights turn on and off with the button press. First we managed to make LED strip light up while the button is pressed. The most challenging part for us was to figure out how to create a toggle switch with the same button. After some research, we created the condition in the code that made the system remember last state of the button. This way we alternated the outcome based on the last and current button state.</p>

          <h2>Day 3</h2>
          <p><span>Capacitive touch interaction</span><br>
            This day we worked on the capacitive touch interaction. We managed to make a toggle switch with the button, but for our final installation we would like to have a capacitive touch interaction. We took as a base the code with the button that we figured out in the previous day, and changed it in a way, that capacitive touch also works as a toggle switch. One the first touch the LEDs light up, on the second touch they turn off.</p>

          <p><span>Capacitive touch with Processing</span><br>
            We also were experimenting with connecting capacitive touch with processing. Our idea was to make each touchpoint draw different visuals in the processing. At the end, we made a connection with the code with the lights and managed to make it work with the processing as well.</p>

          <p><span>Installation set-up</span><br>
            This day we also spent some time in a hardware store trying to figure out how to build our installation. As we were brainstorming what settings and materials to use, we figured out that some ideas that seemed to work in out heads, didn’t seem like working in real life. At this point we are still in the process of figuring out the best setting and materials for the final project.</p>

          <h2>Day 4</h2>
          <p><span>Several touch points</span><br>
            Today we worked mainly on combining several touchpoints, and connect them to different outputs on the interaction. We continued to experiment with LED strips. We managed to make four touchpoints, and each of them lighted up different parts of the LED strip on the touch. Each touchpoint works as a toggle switch, so the lights can be turned off and on. </p>

          <p>After that we experimented with the way the lights work, instead of just turning them on all at the same time, we tried different combinations. For example, "running" lights, so each NeoPixel lights up with delay after another.</p>

          <p><span>Extending LED strip lenght</span><br>
            At this moment we decided to attach together more LED strips and see how it works. We used the wires to connect two LED strips and soldered them together, extending the amount of lights in the circuit. We changed the code a bit as now we had more lights in one chain, so using four capacitive touch points we could include the whole chain of LED strips. At this moment, we managed to include two LED strips in the interaction.</p>
          <p>We also combined it with our decoration for the clouds to see how it would work on the final installation. At this time, the rest of my team was working on connecting capacitive touch to the sounds. Our idea is to also turn on and off different sound based on the touchpoint. Using our code for the lights, we managed to connect it to the processing, and make it work with the sounds as well.</p>

          <h2>Day 5</h2>
          <p>Today our team started with figuring out the set up for our installation. For our final installation we need closed dark space with the ceiling where we can attach our sky. For this we flipped two tables and tried to place the blanket on top. We first tried to create a sitting place with the chair, but felt that it was too high and not very comfortable. Since we want to create the atmosphere of the huts we all built in our childhood, we decided to make the floor with pillows. For that we brought the palette that will work as the floor, and on top of that we decided to put pillows. We still need to figure out how to make the proper ceiling that would be stable between two tables. At the end of the day, we had this prototype ready.</p>

          <p><span>Including MPR121 Capacitive touch board</span><br>
            As we had many touch points, we decided to include MPR121 touch board in our circuit, so we decrease amount of wires needed for connection. I personally was working on creating capacitive touch interaction with MPR121 board with 12 different touchpoints. I spent time to attach it properly to the arduino board and create the connection. My classmate helped me to solder the board to the wires. In the meantime, my group mates were working on connecting the processing and arduino. They created the visuals in processing that would go off with the capacitive touch, as well as music/sounds. Our idea is to allow people switch between different music or sounds with several touchpoints. We also want to have one touchpoint that allows users to switch between animated visuals in processing that will be shown on the ceiling of our installation. We still try to figure out how to make it work without using the projector, as we don’t have space to use that one.</p>

          <p><span>Encountered issues with power supply and MPR121 board</span><br>
            My experience with MPR121 capacitive touch board was a bit frustrating and challenging, as I couldn’t figure out how to make this board work properly. The capacitive touch was not working as expected, the interaction was not clean and didn't give expected output. By the end of the day, I felt a bit frustrated, because our team encountered problems with power supply as well. We had too many LED strips in one circuit, and also we had a wrong battery of 9V that could easily burn the lights. We had to spend some time figuring out what type of power supply we need and how to connect it to the circuit and all the LED strips in a way, that it would be enough for all NeoPixels to work properly. At the end of the day we seem to find a solution, but we have to try it out tomorrow.</p>
          <p>I also tried to solve the issue with the MPR121 board, and after all I managed to figure out the code and create two toggle switches for two LED lights. It turned out I had to connect power wire to 3.3V of the arduino instead of 5V, then the capacitive touch interaction worked properly. Tomorrow I’m planning to try to apply this code to our LED strips.</p>

          <h2>Day 6</h2>
          <p><span>Solving batteries issue</span><br>
            Today we started the day with rearrangement of the batteries to fix the issue with power supply for LED strips. We added power supply in batteries in the beginning of each LED strip to make sure that each of them has enough power to operate properly. It was a bit challenging, as we had to connect properly all the wires and make sure that everything is connected and grounded. After all, we managed to make it work, so for LED strips to work properly we used a battery holder that included four AA batteries that calculated to 6V.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Nevertheless, we encountered another problem. We found out that our LED strips consume 3.6A that made them very bright, but it meant that our batteries would die in an hour of lights being constantly on. That would mean that we have to change the batteries every hour, and considering that we used 12 batteries at the same time to power all LED strips in the circuit, even just for expo we would have to use around 50 batteries. That was too expensive and unsustainable for us, so we started looking for another solutions.

            With the help of Leiden students, we figured out that we could use the power supply that can be plugged in an outlet and provide around 10A, that would be enough for the whole LED strip we used.</p>

            <p><span>Connecting MPR121 board to LED strips</span><br>
              In the meantime, I personally also worked on the code for MPR121 capacitive touch board, connecting it to the LED strips and increasing amount of touchpoints to 6. I combined the code I had from the previous day with the LED lights, and the code for LED strips. As we added more hardware, wires and functions, it became more and more complicated, so it took me some effort to compile the final code for capacitive touch board and LED strips. First I worked with 4 touch points, but at the end, we had it working with 6 touchpoints and different colour modes on LED strips.</p>

          <h2>Day 7</h2>
          <p><span>Setting up LED strips board</span><br>
            This day we started preparing the materials and the set up for our final prototype. We used the wooden board as a base for our ceiling that was placed between two tables. We cut the LED strips in several pieces, so we could position them on the board in the path we needed. We sticked the LED strips to the board, and after that we soldered all the LED strips together. Soldering LED strips was challenging part, as each part had to be soldered with 3 different wires and the connection had to stay good, so the whole LED circuit works properly. For our visuals from the processing we cut the hole in the board, and decided to place the computer screen from another side on the board.</p>
          <img class="example_pictures" src="Day 7/LED strip on the board.jpeg">
          <p>In the middle of the day, when all the lights were already attached to the board, we also received the power supply that we ordered to power LED strips, that worked from being plugged in an outlet. We connected it to out LED scheme and this power supply was working perfectly, as well as LED strips that we soldered. So to say, we connected everything properly and interaction with lights worked properly. We also took some time to extend the wires that we would use for our touchpoints, so we were soldering small pins with the main wires to make them several metres long.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="topic_block">
          <p><span>Visuals in Processing</span><br>
            Our team was also working on specific animations in the processing for visuals in the sky. We created four different abstract visuals that users would be able to choose from to create different atmosphere. We connected these visuals to the capacitive touch, so we could switch between visual using one of the touchpoints.</p>

          <p>Using the logic of the code with LED stripes and visuals, we created the interaction with the sounds. We decided to have four touchpoints for sounds and add three different sounds to each touchpoint. This way a user can combine different sounds and play his own melody. I was looking for different types of sounds like guitar, melody, beats etc. At the end of the day, we had all the interactions coded and connected to the Arduino boards.</p>

          <h2>Day 8</h2>
          <p><span>Putting everything together</span><br>
            On this day we were putting together everything that we worked on the previous days. We put together the base of our set up with tables and the supporting pillars. After that, we attached all the wires to the wooden board that we used for the ceiling and secure them with the tape. We created the decorations for our touchpoints from aluminium foil so it would work properly with the capacitive touch.</p>

            <p><span>Changing capacitive touch sensitivity</span><br>
              This day we figured out, that our capacitive touch doesn’t work properly with everyone. Sometimes the sensor was not sensitive enough that caused delay in reaction, or didn’t react on the touch at all. For that reason, I was working on changing the code in a way, that the sensitivity of capacitive touchboard increased. I managed to work it out and change the code in a way that people who had problems with getting reaction on capacitive touch, could interact with our touchpoints without the problems. We also found out that sometimes specific shoes might prevent capacitive touch to work properly, therefore it was a good idea for us to create the floor with pillows, so people lift their feet from the ground and then capacitive touch doesn’t depend on that.</p>

          <p><span>Finalising the cloudy sky</span><br>
            After we created and attached all the touchpoints to the board, it was time to attach the cloudy part of our sky. We used the material from pillows to create the clouds and attached it to the white base that was made out of kitchen ventilation filter. We had to sew together the parts, so it stays properly together, and glued the pillow material to this base. We got a very nice result because our cloudy sky looked vert fluffy and cosy.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Attaching the clouds to the board was a bit challenging, as by this moment we already had our board attached to the tables and all the wires attached to the Arduino boards. Therefore, we were attaching the sky upside down, we used the stapler gun to attach the clouds to the wodden board. We had to be very careful with this not to destroy the wires connections, as we had wires underneath already attached to the board. On top of the board we placed the computer screen that was used for the visuals. On the floor we placed the wooden palette and pillows on top where the people can sit. At the end, when everything was connected and placed, we covered the installation with the black curtain to created closed dark space as was planned.
            By the end of the day, we had our installation fully set and all the touch points working properly.</p>

          <img class="example_pictures" src="Day 9/Wingplay Team.jpeg">
          <p>We used Friday morning to test our installation with several people and still adjusted the sensitivity of capacitive touch based on the results. After fixing the sensitivity, we did last test with several people and then our installation was ready to present on the expo. </p>

          <p>As we managed to finish most of the things in the previous day, there was not much to do with the installation on Friday. During the expo we had divided shifts within our team when we present our installation to people. We invited people inside our installation, explained them the interaction, used these moments to take photos and videos of users interacting with our installation. Most of comments we got about our installation is that it is very cozy and people would like to have it in their room. During the expo everything went really smooth and everything worked properly. After the expo we took some time to reflect on the experience people had, how everything went, and also cleaned up.</p>

        <h1>Product</h1>
        <div class="topic_block">
          <h2>Escape Hut</h2>
          <p><span>Description: </span>Our product allows people to escape the outside world and create their own universe according to their current mood. We all built blanket houses in our childhoods to be able to spend time there on our own or with our loved ones. We always felt safe and happy in this environment, and we wanted to bring back these memories to our visitors. We created the escape hut that brings you to another universe with colorful cloudy sky, music and abstract visuals. The interaction is open-ended, so users can explore the possibilities of different environments as long as they want. There are 6 touch points to change the colors of the sky, 4 touch points to control the sounds/music, and 1 touch point for the visuals that are part of the sky environment. Many possible combinations of lights, music and visuals, that trigger users’ interest and playfulness to touch around and explore the beatiful outcomes.</p>
          <img class="example_pictures_vertical" src = "Product/sky1.JPG">
          <br><br>
          <p><span>How it works: </span>The cloudy sky is divided in 6 parts with different LED colors. Each touch point for lights has two color modes, so by touching these touch points users can witch between two colors and this way create the combination of colors on the sky that they like the most. There are possiblities for more warm colors like yellow and orange, or more cold colors like purple and blue.</p>
          <img class="example_pictures" src="Product/IMG_0423.jpg">
          <p>The installation also has four touchpoints for the sounds, that were divided in beats, guitar sounds, and two touch points for melodies. Each touch point contains 3 different variations of sounds, so the users can switch between the sounds in one touch point and combine different sound by activating several touch points! They can also turn off completely some of the sounds if they want.</p>
          <p>Last touch point is activating the abstract visuals in the middle of the sky, and has several abstract animated illustrations being drawn in processing. The users can switch between different visuals.</p>
          <img class="example_pictures" src="Product/IMG_0470.jpg">
          <p>The sensors of each touch point are connected to the MPR121 capacitive touch board, so the interaction works on the capacitive touch. We used two Arduino boards, one was connected to the LED strips, and another board is connected to the sounds sensors and visuals sensor.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <div class="topic_block">
        <p><span>Are you content with your product? And why? Does it achieve what you set out to do?</span></p>
        <p>In the beginning we came up with the idea to create something that represents the blanket houses we all built in our childhoods, where we hid and decorated it our way to create our own safe place. I’m very content with our final result because most of people who experienced our installation gave us feedback that it feels very safe, cozy and nice. People mentioned they would like to have it in their rooms and interact more with our installation. I personally also felt that I wanted to interact with our installation and I found it very interactive because it had many different touchpoints that allowed to explore the possibilities of changing the environment around you. I believe that we managed to create the atmopshere and interaction we were aiming for.</p>
        <p><span>What is the quality of your product? Try to quantify/objectively express this.</span></p>
        <p>I believe we managed to achieve quite high quality product with our experience but there were things that could be improved. All our interactions worked properly, so the experience wasn’t interrupted or unclear. I’m really happy with how our installation looked inside, the cloudy sky was very beatiful and LED lights created a very beatiful pattern with the clouds. Nevertheless, I believe we struggled how to set up the installation properly, so it’s stable, and we didn’t want to spend too much money on the materials, so we used what we had on spot. Therefore, the external part of our installation, in my opinion, didn’t look very attractive. 

          All in all, even though externally it didn’t look that attractive, once people got inside our installation they were pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the experience.</p>
        <p><span>Reflect on the process that you have gone through and compare your work/effort to that of the group.</span></p>
        <p>I believe our team worked together quite well, even though we had our disagreements at some points. It felt that everyone was quite stubborn with their own ideas and didn’t want to explore other possibilities.

          These two weeks felt very intense but it was interesting to explore new possibilities with Arduino and code. I liked the process of going from the idea to seeing the result that works exactly the way you wanted. I also enjoyed combining coding with the physical products as it goes beyond computer screens. I enjoyed the most working with the lights and that’s exactly what I spent on most of my time during the lab weeks. I liked working with Arduino board and LED strips and try out different light patterns and possible interactions.
          
          I feel that with this project I contributed mostly in the coding and wiring, while others preferred to work on the Processing or building the physical part of the installation.</p>
          <p><span>How did you spend your time, tell something about this? Were you motivated? Were your expectations met? Did you have a good time? Did you learn a lot? Why? Why not?</span></p>
          <p>These weeks included a lot of frustration, but it was also nice to see the results after we struggled with something. I was happy how our team managed to solve the issues that we faced and come up with good ideas for the final installation. Nevertheless, sometimes I felt that the group dynamics were not fully what I’m used to. The communication within the team sometimes was too one-sided or team members didn’t hear each other. Also, I feel that the space itself caused me some stress. There were a lot of groups around working on their installations and making a lot of noise, so sometimes it was difficult to focus on my own work. At the end of each day I felt very tired, but I was motivated to finish the installation and present an installation that provides a special and engaging experience for EXPO visitors. After all, I believe that we managed to show a high quality work that people liked and provided us with a very positive feedback. One person even said that our installation was the favourite of him from the whole EXPO :)</p>
