          <h2>An elevator</h2>
          <img class="example_pictures" src="Pictures/homeostasis HCI.png" alt="elevator homeostasis">
          <p>Three main needs that the elevator has to perform its primary function are: <span>Weight, Clear destination, and Energy.</span><br><br>
            The weight inside the elevator has to be balanced in order for the elevator to perform. The elevator can perform without weight of “cargo” in case it gets the command from the outside, then the elevator understands that it’s moving to pick up the cargo. But if the command comes from the inside (buttons in the elevator), but the elevator doesn’t feel any added weight, it won’t move, as it interprets this as there is nothing to deliver to the destination, therefore there is no need to move. If there is too much weight added to the elevator, it feels it’s too difficult and not safe to move, so it won’t perform. In this case the elevator feels stressed and avoids additional potential higher stress.<br><br>

            The main purpose of the elevator is to deliver something or someone at the required destination. For this, it has to have a clear destination commanded. If there is no clear destination defined by the external input, the elevator considers it as “no things in my to-do list” and stays in a calm state. If the destination is clearly commanded by the external input (buttons), the elevator feels confident and understands its task.<br><br>
            
            The energy is required to receive the commands on the first place. Without the energy the elevator cannot receive commands, that keeps it in a “sleep mode”. The elevator requires constant connection to the outside energy source to receive commands and perform its tasks.

          <p><span>Description: </span>Description: MarsCat is a bionic pet cat aiming to be a home robot. This robot is aimed to comfort people, be a pet for people who cannot have real cats at home, or also can be used for education and commerce. The MarsCat is fully responsive, which means it interacts with the environment and people. It can feel the touch, hear the voice, see the objects. The robot can be totally independent, therefore it will perform some actions even without external input or interaction. While being independent, it can run around, sleep, stretch and other things that a normal cat would do. It can play with toys or react on the interaction with human.<br><br>

            AI enables this robot to act like a real cat, going through sequence from sensor to actions, using its memories stored in the system. Therefore, the cat processes the signal from the sensor, plans the behaviour, plans the action, and the acts.<br><br>
            
            What is interesting, the personality of each robot cat is different, as it develops based on how a human pets it. It can be energetic or lazy, social or shy, enthusiastic or alienated. The character changes based on how often and in which way a human interacts with the cat, for example how a human talks to it and how often, or how often it’s touched and played with.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>       
        <div class = "topic_block">
          <p>This topic makes me feel that the future I saw in the movies in my childhood is already here. It’s amazing how smoothly and natural some robots can act and perform. I especially liked the idea of using the robots for socially important aspects like helping eldely people or solving the issues of exploitation (like animals in the zoo). Definitely a lot of work goes into creating sophisticated artificial creatures that are fully responsive and interact with their environment. Nevertheless, as many experts and people nowadays, I also think of the future development of this area and how it will affect our lives. For example, some robots might substitute people in some physically difficult jobs, which might be good, but also might leave a lot of people without jobs. Or what if AI becomes too intelligent and wouldn’t listen to people’s commands anymore, so it would be difficult to avoid harm from it. I feel that something inside of me goes against the creatures that feel too developed and intelligent, so to say my mind cannot accept the fact that it is real. It is all fun and nice until it feels too real and threatening. This topic really interested me and motivated me to reflect on our future as humanity, where probably humans will be in close interaction with robots and AI.</p>
