            <h2>02 Shape</h2>
            <p>In this assignment we explored the possibility to add different simple shapes in the virtual environment. I tried how to position the elements and rotate them in the virtual environment, how attributes differ from shape to shape. After exploration, in step 6 I added the ground using the "plane" shape and different shapes that I found in the A-Frame library.</p>

            <p><span>04 Animations: Step 7</span><br>
            In step 7 for the animations I played around with the possibilities and explored what other animations I could create with these two boxes. First I created the animation with the changing position of one of the boxes. After that I added the animation with the color and rotation, so the color of the box blends from blue to pink over time of the animation and the box spins at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Advanced: 05 Interactions</h2>
            <p><span>05 Interactions: Step 1-4</span><br>
                In this block I learned how to trigger the animations based on the events like mouseenter and mouseleave. I added the rotation speed to the box as the mouse enters the box, or stretched the width of the box. In previous exercises, as the mouse hovered over the box, it kept rotating at the same speed always after. According to the assignment, I changed the code the way that once the mouse leaves the box, its speed gets back to the original one.

            <h2>Advanced: 06 Interaction Headset</h2>
            <p><span>06 Interaction Headset: Step 3</span><br>
                In this step I customised the cursor apperance, so I expanded the radius of the circle that represents the cursor, and added the color animation, so cursor color fades from blue to pink. After that I was playing around with the fuse function that delays the outcome once the cursor is over the element. I changed the fuseTimeOut to 1s instead of 1.5s, so it reacts faster, and made the rotation speed of the right box increase every time the cursor is over the box. The left box changes its rotation by 45 degrees on all axis every time the cursor is over the right box.
