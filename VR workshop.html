                <h2>Project 1. 2D Platformer</h2>
                <p>For the first tutorial I decided to work with the 2D Platformer game. 

                    In first steps, I learned how to navigate around the game frame and move objects. Then I learned how to customise the player character and its characteristics in a game, so I changed his maximum speed from 3 to 10, and changed his colour. It was quite difficult to control the player on speed 10, so I changed it back to 3 afterwards.</p>

                    <p>After that I added new enemies in the game, changed their position, as well as customised them by changing their size, rotation, and colour. With colour it was interesting that it worked a bit different than with the player character, as enemy elements have texture and shadows, so colour changing worked a bit more complicated. I struggled a bit with the enemy position, as I didn’t understand that I had to drag the arrows and not the object itself in order to make it move the direction I needed. After all, I figured it out.</p>

                    <p>After that, I also played around with the items in the game, like diamonds, added more of them and changed their colour. Instead of changing colour of all of them one by one, I chose the entity “tokens” and then with one action changed the colour of all of them.</p>

                        <h2>Project 2. FPS</h2>
                        <p>For the second tutorial I customised FPS microgame.

                            First I learned how to change move around the game space and change the characteristics of the player in a game, for example by changing the gravity force I changed how high the player can jump.</p>

                            <p>Then I also customised the space of the game, so I changed the colour of the floor, but also added a new room. To make it possible for enemies and the player to enter the room, I baked this new room in a game according to the tutorial.</p>

                            <p>After that I also learned how to add new enemy units in the game and change their position.</p>
                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-vb3sQu-lE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>At the end, I had customised space, new enemies and changed player characteristics for the FPS game.</p>

            <h2>02 Shape</h2>
            <p>In this assignment we explored the possibility to add different simple shapes in the virtual environment. I tried how to position the elements and rotate them in the virtual environment, how attributes differ from shape to shape. After exploration, in step 6 I added the ground using the "plane" shape and different shapes that I found in the A-Frame library.</p>

            <span>Assignment: </span>The box only rotates around the X axis. Add to the code so it revolves around all the

            <p><span>04 Animations: Step 7</span><br>
            In step 7 for the animations I played around with the possibilities and explored what other animations I could create with these two boxes. First I created the animation with the changing position of one of the boxes. After that I added the animation with the color and rotation, so the color of the box blends from blue to pink over time of the animation and the box spins at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Advanced: 05 Interactions</h2>
            <p><span>05 Interactions: Step 1-4</span><br>
                In this block I learned how to trigger the animations based on the events like mouseenter and mouseleave. I added the rotation speed to the box as the mouse enters the box, or stretched the width of the box. In previous exercises, as the mouse hovered over the box, it kept rotating at the same speed always after. According to the assignment, I changed the code the way that once the mouse leaves the box, its speed gets back to the original one.

            <h2>Advanced: 06 Interaction Headset</h2>
            <p><span>06 Interaction Headset: Step 3</span><br>
                In this step I customised the cursor apperance, so I expanded the radius of the circle that represents the cursor, and added the color animation, so cursor color fades from blue to pink. After that I was playing around with the fuse function that delays the outcome once the cursor is over the element. I changed the fuseTimeOut to 1s instead of 1.5s, so it reacts faster, and made the rotation speed of the right box increase every time the cursor is over the box. The left box changes its rotation by 45 degrees on all axis every time the cursor is over the right box.
