                <h2>Wearables</h2>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="topic_block">
          <p>When it comes to wearables, most of people think of smartwatches and blinking sneakers. But wearable technologies go much beyond that because wearables can be anything that is…portable and wearable! In this topic the possibilities and limitations of wearable technologies are explored.</p>

        <h1>New Concept</h1>
        <div class = "topic_block">
          <p><span>The Wearable: </span>Bracelet</p>
          <p><span>The Purpose: </span>Initiate romantic dating</p>
          <p><span>Description: </span>A bracelette that indicates when someone is interested in another person or finds him/her attractive could help people recognise romantic signals and make people approach each other in case of mutual interest.<br><br>

            When we have romantic interest in someone, we have specific body and brain reactions. For this concept, people would have specific sensors attached to their head that recognise brain waves and mood change. When the person’s brain shows the signals of romantic interest in someone, the electrodes would send the signal to the bracelet, and the bracelet would change the color. Lilac/Purple color would indicate that the person shows signs of attraction. The bracelet is made out of metal and the size is designed individually for each person, the bracelet has a small screen that indicates the color. This bracelet would help people recognise romantic interest and motivate to approach each other in case of mutual interest.</p>

          <h2>ISSEY MIYAKE BAOBAO BAG CONCEPTUAL BY KIMBAB</h2>
          <p><span>Creator: </span>KIMBAB</p>
          <a href = "https://kimbab.me/portfolio/issey-miyake-baobao-bag-conceptual-by-kimbab/" target="_blank"><p>Project page</p></a>
          <p><span>Description: </span>In this project the bag becomes like a whole art installation. The creator used 144 smart LEDs to create animated pattern on the bag. To imitate the bag, the creator used 7-Segment LED Display and attached handle. I really like this project because it shows how regular bags can be transformed into something more creative, and with changing patterns, the bag can have so many different styles. By buying one bag and having several modes, people could change it based on their mood or occassion, so in one bag you could have many different styles. Moreover, I like the patterns that the creator created himself as they look fascinating.</p>

          <h2>The MuttMentor</h2>
          <p><span>Team: </span>Salma Mayorquin and Terry Rodriquez</p>
          <a href = "https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/whatsupdog/the-muttmentor-9d9753?ref=tag&ref_id=wearables&offset=24" target="_blank"><p>Project page</p></a>
          <p><span>Description: </span>This smart dog collar is aimed to track the pet’s training progress. The wearable is attached to a dog and recognises the tricks like jump, sit or roll over. The device is connected to the app where owners can track the progress and success of trainings. It’s connected to voice commands and what tricks the pet performed to analyse if the trick was a success, if a dog followed the order.<br><br>

            I find it interesting how creators approached the project and how many different steps they had to make to teach this wearable as AI to recognise the tricks and commands. I found the process itself very interesting and inspiring, because instead of using the default interactions that arduino recognises, they used AI approach to teach it the interactions they needed for their own project, and it differs then how you use and approach this technology.</p>

          <h2>Third Eye for The Blind</h2>
          <p><span>Team: </span>Muhammed Azhar</p>
          <a href = "https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammedazhar/third-eye-for-the-blind-8c246d?ref=tag&ref_id=wearables&offset=3" target="_blank"><p>Project page</p></a>
          <p><span>Description: </span>The technology is aimed to help blind people to navigate in the space without holding additional items. The ultrasonic sensors that recognise the distance are placed on five different body parts of a person - shoulders, knees and a hand. When a person is close to an obstacle, the devise starts beeping and vibrating, as an obstacle is closer the beeping and vibration intensifies. I like this project as it has a socially importan aim and could improve blind people’s navigation, as then they wouldn’t have to hold additional items in their hands, that might be annoying, and creates inconvenience. This is the example how quite simple approach and techology can make someone’s life easier and create significant change.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>       
        <div class = "topic_block">
          <p>For this topic for me the biggest insight was how many different technologies are there and available for wearables. Mostly, when I think about wearables, I think of the smart watch or some fancy sneakers. But while making research I found out about so many interesting and fascinating projects, and some of them people were doing just for fun, like, for example, upgrading their prom dress to have “falling stars” on it using LED lights. I believe that smart wearables have big potential in health system, as well as fashion, as it can offer people many styles in one item just by changing its settings with smart technologies. All in all, I found this topic very interesting, but for me personally it was a bit more difficult to comprehend the technologies behind all the ideas, in comparison to two previous topics.</p>
