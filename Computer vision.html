        <h1>Assignment 3: Add Colour</h1>
        <div class = "assignment_block">
            <div class="assignment_description">
                <p>For this assignment I added a colour to a sketch, that appears in the range of different shades of purple. The colour is added to the sketch on the mouse being clicked and hold. As the mouse is release, the sketch starts drawing in white colour again.</p>

        <h1>Assignment 7: Computer Vision</h1>
        <div class = "assignment_block">
            <div class="assignment_description">
                <p>For this assignment I modified the code that allows skeleton and face tracking with PoseNet. First I changed it to the small rectangles that appear in different random colours that makes them look like they are blinking.</p>

             <div class="assignment_description">
                <p>Afterwards I decided to experiment with it a bit, and I changed the rectangles to stars, so it looks more fun and playful.</p>

        <h1>Assignment 8: Hand position and distance</h1>       
        <div class = "assignment_block">
            <div class="assignment_description">
                <p>The rectangle changes its width to fit between the hands. The width of the rectangle equals to the distance between wrists, and I also added the additional interaction that the rectangle starts changing the colour once its width exceeds a specific value.</p>

        <h1>Assignment 9: Cheer detection</h1>       
        <div class = "assignment_block">
            <div class="assignment_description">
                <p>The stars appear on the cheering pose. Once the wrists are above the shoulders, that is a usual pose for cheering, it triggers the system to draw stars on the place of wrists, and as a person waves with hands, the size of stars changes. The furter hands are from each other, the bigger is the size of stars.</p>
